TODO:

    Allow the Argument to be a call to an Application
        The application call can be in the "value" attribute of the argument
        The application call can be the entire argument definition.

        The application can return
            a single string ("value" attribute as application call)
                The right part of a GNU argument (single string)
                The value of a POSIX argument (array of strings)
            an array of strings (entire argument definition as application call)
                The entire argument is basically the outcome of the application

    Allow the Argument to return (normal argument definition)
        a single string (GNU)
        an array of strings (case of POSIX argument)

    Think about the different Workflows:
        The computer starts and the user decides on what to work (Usual case scenario)
        The user is working in a Context and decides to start working in a different Context
            Store the last Context you were working in
            Offer the option of closing the Context
            Offer the option to switch to another Context
            See when was the last reboot:

Contexts to create:

	Create an option work in my Website:
		Open the Hosting page
		Open VS Code with the website project
		Open Filezilla
		Open the browser showing the page in desktop
		Open the browser showing the page in mobile
		Docker container with the Apache web server + PHP installed ???

    Create an option work in my MDWiki:
		Open a terminal in the directory of the project
		Open VS Code with the wiki project
		Open the Hosting page
		Open the Manage packet in the hosting area
		Open the browser showing the wiki in the hosting (the real one)
		Start the python_web_server in the directory of the MDWiki project in local
		Open the browser showing the wiki in the local environment

Future Functionality to add to contexts:
	Recognise the Network you are connected at
		i.e. Start the VPN when I am connected at home and I work at Uniscon
		    https://askubuntu.com/questions/57339/connect-disconnect-from-vpn-from-the-command-line
		i.e. Start the VPN when I am connected anywhere outside of the office and I work at Uniscon
		i.e. Do NOT start the VPN when I am at the office
