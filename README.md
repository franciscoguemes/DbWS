This project is the basis for the DbWS (Develop by Wire System) which pretends to automatize all routinary tasks that as a developer I carry out every day such as:

	-Select the computer set up on startup. Choose whether you will be working in a:
		-Company project
		-Personal project
		-Other tasks... (I.e. You switch on the computer just to reply some email).

	-Based on these preferences the DbWS will set up your environmnet for the chosen task, this
	 may include:
		-Open browsers
		-Start the IDE
		-Show the status of the Docker containers
		-Etc ...




Future Lines of Work:
	Integrate this project with the iworkin project
	Integrate with Dragonfire
